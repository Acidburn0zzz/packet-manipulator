    'The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an IETF-defined signaling protocol,'

    'Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol can be used for creating,'

    'sessions consisting of one or several media streams.'
    'The modification can involve changing addresses or ports, inviting more'
    'participants, and adding or deleting media streams. Other feasible'
    'application examples include video conferencing, streaming multimedia distribution,'
    'instant messaging, presence information, file transfer and online games.'
    'SIP was originally designed by Henning Schulzrinne and Mark Handley starting in 1996.'
    'The latest version of the specification is RFC 3261 from the IETF Network Working'
