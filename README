Introduction

   PacketManipulator is a network scanning frontend.

   PacketManipulator is developed in the Python programming language, and
   its interface is built with the GTK Toolkit.

   The project goal is to develop a frontend that is really useful for
   advanced users and easy to be used by newbies. With PacketManipulator,
   network admin can forge custom packets and send them over the wire
   to analyze the network, sniff on a selected interface or simply edit
   a pcap file for further replay.

   For bugs/suggestions please contact the author or create a ticket on
