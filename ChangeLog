    * PacketManipulator:
        - Added --debug option to spawn a gdb session when the launcher is
          started.
    * PM/PacketManipulator: 
        - now we require pygtk >= 2.14
    * PM/Gui/Pages/SniffPage.py:
        - 80 columns line wrap fixed.
        - Created two differents treemode to store informations (gtk.ListStore
          to improve the performance while sniffing, and gtk.TreeStore to have
          the possibility to use the flow organizer)
    * PM/Gui/Dialogs/Interface.py:
        - 80 columns line wrap fixed.
        - Added a new ComboBox to select the method to use for the SniffSession
        - Set a tooltip to the pcap filter info button
        - Fixed various alignment bugs.
    * PM/Gui/Dialogs/Preferences.py:
        - Adding a new 'Helpers' section letting the user choose the correct 
          path for tcpdump and dumpcap programs.
    * PM/Backend/Scapy/Context/Sniff.py:
        - Adding the possibility to use tcpdump/pcap or virtual interface for
          sniffing to avoid performance problems or CPU burning as reported.

          These methods (tcpdump/dumpcap) should remove the risk of packet
          loss also, but uses a temporary file created with tempfile.mktemp()

          In this case we use fcntl to set O_NONBLOCK to stderr pipe created
          by the subprocess module. This code works on *NIX and *BSD systems
          that offers select() over simple file descriptor. I should implement
          the missing code for Windows system and use PeekNamedPipe.
        - Implemented error propagation trough exit_from_thread() method
    * PM/Backend/Scapy/Context/Static.py:
        - Avoid a cumulative call to PacketList constructor to reduce memory
          usage.

    Various bugfix.
