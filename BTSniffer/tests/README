The contents of this directory mimic that of the package hierarchy for BTSniffer.
The tests should also be organized in the same packages as the modules to be tested.

Run run_all.py to execute tests.

run_all will build the project using disutils, copy the tests, run the tests (using nosetest), report and subsequently clean up.
